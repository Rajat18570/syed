                                    As I pen down these words, a flurry of thoughts run through my mind, perhaps too deep to be expressed with words. Although it's just been 5 months since I joined Syed sir, the tremendous way in which my academics and me as an individual have changed has left myself in awe. Syed sir has a knack for recognize students as they are, clearing their basics and slowly advancing to higher levels in such a subtle manner that we don't even realize it. He's perhaps the only teacher I have met so far who looks to change the students' point of view towards studies and life. He teaches us, quote unquote, "How to look at the part of glass which is empty and not which is full." At Syed Sir Classes, we are prepared to excel in academics as well as life. Thank you so much sir for your constant support!!
